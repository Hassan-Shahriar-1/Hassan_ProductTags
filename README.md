# interesting findings
 -> process of create schema file maybe in previous version there was php file right now they are using xml file for it in magento 2
 -> process of module registratin process is dependency injection which is configured by di.xml file (not able to explore this file yet) to see how it actually work

# chanlenges faced
    -> docker setup was good but needed adobe account so many things which kill my time (maybe due to have zero knowdledge in magento)
