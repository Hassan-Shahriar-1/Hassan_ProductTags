# 🏷️ Magento 2 - Product Tags Module

A custom Magento 2 module for managing product tags through the admin panel and optionally rendering them on the frontend.

---

## 🔍 Interesting Findings

- Magento 2 uses **XML files (`db_schema.xml`)** to define database schema instead of PHP-based setup scripts used in older versions.
  
- **Module registration** involves two files:
  - `registration.php` – Registers the module with Magento
  - `etc/module.xml` – Declares module name and version

- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is configured via `etc/di.xml`, allowing Magento to auto-resolve class dependencies and bind interfaces to implementations.

- The **ResourceModel** acts as a bridge between the model and database. Magento uses a three-part pattern:  
  **Model → ResourceModel → Collection**  
  Although it may feel overly abstract, this promotes clean architecture and testability.

- Magento strongly recommends the **Repository Pattern** to abstract business logic from direct model/data layer interaction. This improves flexibility, test coverage, and clean separation.

- **Routing** is XML-based and defined in `routes.xml`. Each route maps to a controller action.

- A **Controller Action** typically returns a page using:
  ```php
  return $this->resultPageFactory->create();


## 🧪 Challenges Faced

- ✅ Docker setup was smooth and functional, but setting up Magento required an **Adobe account** and Marketplace authentication, which consumed time and added complexity — especially challenging with **zero prior Magento experience**.

- 🤯 Understanding the **Model → ResourceModel → Collection (MRC)** architecture was difficult at first. The decoupled, layered system is powerful but not beginner-friendly.

- 📦 Magento's **complex XML configuration system** (used for layout, DI, routes, and schema) requires a lot of precision. A missing attribute or typo can silently break functionality, making debugging frustrating.

- 🧩 The **UI Component system** for admin forms and grids is powerful but overly verbose and difficult to grasp without prior experience. Connecting form fields to data sources through `form.xml`, data providers, and layout handles took time to fully understand.
